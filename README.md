## Cloud Computing :cloud: 
It is the delivery of computing services over the internet. The services include are as follows  <br> 
:zap:Server  <br> 
:zap:storage  <br> 
:zap:database  <br> 
:zap:networking  <br> 
:zap:software  <br> 
:zap:analytics  <br> 
:zap:intelligence  <br> 
Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scales.  <br>  




## Cloud Advantages :cloud:
:small_orange_diamond: Trade “capital expense” for “variable expense”  <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Benefit from massive economies of scale  <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Stop guessing capacity  <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers  <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Go global in minutes  <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: High availability : If one of the regions is down, you can serve the application from the other regions <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Low latency : Serve users from the nearest region to them <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Global footprint <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Adhere to government regulation <br> 


## Benefits of Cloud  :cloud: 
:small_blue_diamond:  **High Availability** — The major cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP) have multiple data centers spread around throughout the world. Data and code stored in the cloud are copied to more than one data center. If anything happens to one data center, the data can be recovered from another data center.  <br> 
:small_blue_diamond: **Fault Tolerance** — In case there is any fault in the application or infrastructure, the service can continue to work by moving the work to other healthy servers.  <br> 
:small_blue_diamond: **Disaster Discover** — The data in the cloud can also get copied to other regions e.g. copy data from West US to East US. If there is natural disaster happened in West US and every data center goes down, the data center in East US will still have the copy of data.  <br> 
:small_blue_diamond: **Scalability** — The application running in the cloud can expand its size when there are more users in the system.  <br> 
:small_blue_diamond: **Elasticity** — The application running in the cloud can shrink its size when there are fewer users in the system. The users can also set automatic shutdown during the non-business hours to save money.  <br> 

## Availability Zones :cloud: 
Availability zones consists of one or more discrete data center. Each availability has independent & redundant power, networking & connectivity. It should also be noted that availability zones in a region are connected through low-latency links.


## Business benefits of cloud  :cloud: 
:small_blue_diamond: **Agility** - The machines in the cloud are ready for cloud users to fire when they need and power down when they are not required  <br> 

:small_blue_diamond: **Economies of scale** — Cloud is a shared pool of machines and services. As the number of customer grows, the cloud providers can cut down the cost and at same time increase quality of the services  <br> 

:small_blue_diamond: **Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx)** — Building a data center requires large capital investment for hardware as well as the facility. A data center will also require ongoing electricity and staffs cost for operation. By using cloud, the capital expenditure for building a data center is not required.  <br> 

:small_blue_diamond: **Consumption-based model (pay-as-you-go)** — The cloud users only need to pay what they use.  <br> 


## Types of Cloud Service Offering  :cloud: 

:large_blue_diamond: **IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)** - In this offering, cloud user will only use Infrastructure from cloud provider will be responsible for 
Virtualization, Hardware & Networking while cloud user will be responsible for os Upgrades and Patches, Database Software and Upgrades, Database Configuration( Table, 
Indexes, Views etc),Data, Scaling of Compute& Storage, Availability and Durability. <br> 

:large_blue_diamond: **PaaS (Platform as a service)** In this offering as compared to above Cloud provider is responsible for Virtualization, Hardware & Networking,
 Database Software and Upgrades,Scaling,Availability and Durability. Cloud User Will be responsible for Database Configuration( Table, 
Indexes, Views etc),Data. Example Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB etc.  <br> 

:large_blue_diamond: **SaaS (Software as a service)** In this offering cloud provider will be responsible for OS (Inc Upgrades & Patches), Application Runtime, Auto Scaling, Availability and Load balancing, Application code & Configuration. Cloud User will be responsible for Configuring the Software. <br> 

## Cloud Models  :cloud: 

:small_blue_diamond: **Public cloud** Public cloud is cloud computing that’s delivered via the internet and shared across organizations. <br> 

:small_blue_diamond: **Private cloud** Private cloud is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization. <br> 

:small_blue_diamond: **Hybrid cloud** Hybrid cloud is an environment that uses both public and private clouds.. <br> 

## Cloud Pricing  :cloud: 

:small_blue_diamond: **Pay as you go** -  User can pay for the services on Azure according to actual usage, billed per second, with no long-term commitment or upfront payments. This provides complete flexibility to increase or decrease resources as needed. Azure virtual machines (VMs) can be automatically scaled up and down using Azure's autoscaling features. 

:small_blue_diamond: **Reserved Instance** - Azure provides Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (RVMI) - Virtual machines that are pre-purchased for one or three years in a specific region. Committing to reserved instances in advance grant a discount of up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go prices. Azure provides the option to replace reserved instances with others during the commitment term. It also allows users to cancel reserved instances before the end of the term, but this incurs an early termination fee.

:small_blue_diamond: **Spot Pricing** - Azure lets you buy unused computing power at a discount of up to 90% compared to pay-as-you-go prices. However, Spot instances can be interrupted on short notice, so they are considered to be suitable only for workloads that can tolerate disruptions. Azure provides Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), an autoscaling mechanism that lets you manage groups of VMs and add spot instances automatically according to predefined policies.
